## 🚀 Getting Started

Research Memory addresses a fundamental challenge in academic research: **context continuity across AI sessions**.

Instead of starting every conversation with "Where did we leave off?", you can:

- **Restore project context instantly** with natural language
- **Maintain searchable research memory** across sessions
- **Never lose important decisions** or experimental insights

### Quick Start

```bash
# Clone or copy to your research project
cp -r research-memory/* your-project/

# Use in Claude Code
"Hey, help me get back up to speed with my research using research-memory"
```

## 🎯 Use Cases

### For Individual Researchers
- **Multi-project management**: Seamlessly switch between different research projects
- **Long-term studies**: Maintain context across months or years of work
- **Reproducibility**: Complete audit trail of decisions and experiments

### For Research Teams
- **Knowledge transfer**: New team members quickly get up to speed
- **Collaboration continuity**: Shared understanding of project decisions
- **Documentation automation**: Reduce manual documentation overhead

### For Academic Writers
- **Literature review continuity**: Never lose track of analysis decisions
- **Methodology documentation**: Complete record of analytical choices
- **Revision tracking**: Understand why specific approaches were chosen

## 🛠️ Technical Features

- **Local-first design**: Your research memory stays on your machine
- **Git-friendly**: Version control your research decisions
- **Multi-language support**: English, Japanese, and Chinese documentation
- **Zero dependencies**: Works with Python 3.8+ and Claude Code only
