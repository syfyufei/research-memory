description: Log current work session to research memory
---

Use the research-memory skill to log the current work session.

Analyze the conversation history and extract:
- Session goal and main objective
- Summary of changes made
- Experiments conducted (hypothesis, dataset, model, metrics, notes)
- Key decisions made (decision, rationale, alternatives considered)
- New TODOs and completed items
- Research phases (data_preprocess, modeling, robustness, etc.)

Then call the `research_memory_log_session` tool with the structured information.

Confirm what was logged and where it was saved.
