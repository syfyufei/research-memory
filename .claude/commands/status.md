Use the research-memory skill to show a quick project status overview.

Call the `research_memory_bootstrap` tool and present a concise summary including:
- **Project name and main objective**
- **Last updated**: When was the last session logged
- **Recent progress**: Brief 1-2 line summary of latest work
- **Current phase**: Which research phase (data_preprocess, modeling, robustness, etc.)
- **Active TODOs**: Number of open vs completed items
- **Quick stats**:
  - Total sessions logged
  - Total experiments conducted
  - Total decisions recorded

Present this in a compact, dashboard-style format that can be quickly scanned.
