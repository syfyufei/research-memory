description: Restore project context and generate work plan
---

Use the research-memory skill to bootstrap the project context.

Call the `research_memory_bootstrap` tool to:
- Load the project overview from `memory/project-overview.md`
- Show recent development log entries from `memory/devlog.md`
- List current TODOs from `memory/todos.md`
- Generate a suggested work plan for today

Present the information in a clear, organized format and suggest what the user should work on next.
